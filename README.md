  <em>Empowering patients with secure, private, and decentralized control over their medical data.</em>
</div>

## 🚀 Overview
Healthnet revolutionizes the way medical records are managed by leveraging **blockchain technology** and **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**. It provides a secure, decentralized platform where patients retain full ownership of their medical data, while healthcare providers can access records only with explicit patient consent. This ensures **privacy, transparency, and data integrity** in the healthcare ecosystem.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- **🔒 Decentralized Storage**: Medical records are stored on IPFS, ensuring immutability and accessibility.  
- **⛓ Blockchain-Powered Access Control**: Ethereum smart contracts manage and enforce access permissions.  
- **👩‍⚕️ Patient-Centric Design**: Patients control who can access their data and for how long.  
- **🔐 End-to-End Security**: Data is encrypted and accessible only to authorized parties.  
- **🌐 Interoperable**: Seamlessly integrates with existing healthcare systems using standard protocols.  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js  
- **Backend**: Solidity (Ethereum Smart Contracts)  
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Testnet/Local Hardhat)  
- **File Storage**: IPFS  
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask  
- **Web3 Interaction**: Ethers.js  
- **Development Tools**: Hardhat, VS Code  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)  
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)  
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)  
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)  

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GitPreethiHub/Healthnet.git
cd Healthnet
```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
```bash
yarn install
```

3. **Start Local Blockchain**  
```bash
npx hardhat node
```

4. **Deploy Smart Contract**  
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

5. **Start the React App**  
```bash
cd client
yarn start
```

## 🎯 Usage

### Uploading Medical Records
1. Connect your **MetaMask** wallet.  
2. Navigate to the **Upload** section.  
3. Enter the record details and upload the file to **IPFS**.  
4. The record's IPFS hash is securely stored on the blockchain.  

### Granting Access
1. Go to the **Access Management** section.  
2. Enter the Ethereum address of the healthcare provider.  
3. Grant access using your MetaMask wallet.  

### Viewing Medical Records (As a Healthcare Provider)
1. Log in using **MetaMask**.  
2. Access granted records via the dashboard.  
3. Revoke access anytime through the permissions panel.  

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations
- **Blockchain Security**: All transactions are immutable and verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain.  
- **Permission Control**: Only authorized addresses can access specific records.  
- **Data Integrity**: Records are stored on IPFS, ensuring they cannot be altered.  

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- **🔐 Data Encryption**: Implement advanced encryption mechanisms for IPFS data.  
- **🌐 Multi-Blockchain Support**: Extend support to other blockchains like Polygon.  
- **🧪 Automated Testing**: Integrate with tools like Mocha or Chai for automated smart contract testing.  
- **📱 Mobile App**: Develop a mobile version for easier access.
